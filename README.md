# Tic Tac Toe (Python Console Game)

A simple **Tic Tac Toe** game built with **Python**.  
The game allows two players to play alternately in the console, marking positions on a 3×3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a tie.

`````
4. The game announces when a player wins or if it's a tie.
5. After the game ends, players can choose to replay.
